                <h5>We respect your privacy</h5>
                <p>The following provides an overview of how your privacy is protected on this website:</p>
            
                <h5>What information do we gather?</h5>
                <p>
                    Information on the KMLNGMLKS Innovations website is gathered in two ways:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>indirectly (for example, through our site's technology);</li>
                        <li>and directly (for example, when you provide information on various pages of the ADEC Innovations website).</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    An example of how we collect information indirectly is through our Internet access logs. When you access the ADEC Innovations website, your Internet address is automatically collected and placed in our access logs.
                    One way we collect information is through the use of cookies. Cookies are small files that save and retrieve information about your visit to the ADEC Innovations website such as how you entered and navigated through our site. The cookies we use identify you by number, not by name. If you are uncomfortable regarding the use of cookies, you can disable cookies on your computer by changing the settings in the preferences or options menu of your browser.
                    We also collect information when you voluntarily submit it to us. Throughout our site, we provide the opportunity to fill out a contact form, register for an event or conference, order a white paper, or participate in an online survey. When we collect this type of information, we notify you as to why we are asking for the information and how this information will be used. It is completely up to you whether or not you want to provide it.
                </p>
            
                <h5>How do we use this information?</h5>
                <p>
                    We aggregate and analyze information to determine what is most effective about our site and to help us identify ways to improve it. If you voluntarily submit information, we use it to address your inquiry, improve our service, or process your information in accordance with the explanation we gave you when we collected the data from you.
                </p>
            
                <h5>Do we share your information with outside parties?</h5>
                <p>As a global organization, we may share your information with employees of ADEC Innovations but only to the extent necessary to answer your inquiry or concerns. On some occasions, we may need to share information with trusted vendors and business partners. For example, if you sign up for an online webinar, we may need to submit your data to a webinar vendor so they can send you login information. But again, before you submit any information, we will notify you as to why we are asking for specific information and how we intend to use it.</p>

                <h5>What about sensitive personal data?</h5>
                <p>
                    We do not collect sensitive personal data through this site. If we have a need to collect such data to provide our services or to answer your inquiries, we will secure your prior consent.
                </p>

                <h5>Do we give you access to your information?</h5>
                <p>
                    You are entitled to know whether we hold information about you and, if we do, to have access to that information. You may also require your information to be corrected if it is inaccurate.
                </p>
                
                <h5>How long do we retain your data?</h5>
                <p>
                    We retain your data for the period necessary to fulfill the purpose for which we collected them, after which we destroy them according to the companyâ€™s data disposal policy.
                </p>

                <h5>What about data security?</h5>
                <p>
                    We take appropriate steps to maintain the security of your data on the ADEC Innovations website.  While we use reasonable technical and administrative measures within our means to protect your data, you must understand that the open nature of the Internet is such that data may flow over networks without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended.
